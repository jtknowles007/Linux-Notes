# GIT Notes

## 12/10/2017

* Basic push to GitHub
    + git add to add <file> to update what will be committed
    + git add* to add all files that were touched for commit
    + can also use git commit -a to do the same
    + combine add and commit message by using git commit -a -m "your message here"
    + git push - will be asked for username and password
    + It appears that the benefit of specifically naming each file with add <filename> then committing individually is that you can give each commited file a specific commit comment.  If this is not important - if all files commited can have the same comment - you can use the add* and commit -m OR git commit -a -m "your message here" to take care of it all in one fell swoop.
